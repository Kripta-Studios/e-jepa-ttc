# Progress Log

## 2026-06-30

Read `README_FIRST.md`, `DATASETS.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.

Decisions:

- Follow the milestone order from `AGENTS.md`.
- Start with M0/M1 and the data-facing part of M2/M3.
- Do not train or report performance metrics until the loader, splits, and representations are
  tested.
- Treat the local EvTTC data as a mini smoke subset, not as a final evaluation corpus.
- Ignore `.bag` and `.mp4` files for the first MVP; use HDF5, `ttc.csv`, and labels.

Known limitations:

- The `ttc.csv` column names are inferred from local rows and must be confirmed with official
  documentation before final experiments.
- The local subset has only one scenario family, so the default split is by full sequence rather
  than by stronger cross-family protocol.
- Training, JEPA, uncertainty, export, and demo milestones remain pending.
- On this Windows path, editable installs create a `.pth` file with the non-ASCII user path encoded
  incompatibly for CPython 3.11. Use `uv sync --all-groups --no-editable` and
  `uv run --no-sync ...`.
